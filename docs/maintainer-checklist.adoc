== Overview

This document provides a summary of the xref:maintainers-guide.adoc[Maintainer's Guide] in the
form of a checklist to help maintainers in their duties.

== Start of Cycle

* [ ] Create `seen` branch for your mirror
* [ ] Send email
  * [ ] Subject: Release Cycle XXXX-XX-XX -- XXXX-XX-XX is the end of
        the cycle
  * [ ] Include the tag's object hash & commit hash of the last
        release cycle
  * [ ] Include the URL to the `master` branch
  * [ ] Include the URL to the `seen` branch
  * [ ] Include seen patches -- commit hash, tag name, and Published-as

The hash for the tag can be retrieved by using `git-show-ref`, for example:

```
$ git show-ref cycle/2021-10-05
c37a6ff141aea58615a72f974732c077a7f396a1 refs/tags/cycle/2021-10-05
```

The commit for the tag can be seen by using `git log` and seeing the
SHA it points to.

NOTE: all URL's above should point to your mirror of the
`radicle-link` repository.

== Daily

* [ ] Reply to `Release Cycle XXXX-XX-XX`
  * [ ] Inlcude what has been merged
  * [ ] Inlcude what has been seen
  * [ ] Inlcude what needs more approval

== End of Cycle

* [ ] Generate shortlog `git shortlog $PREV_CYCLE $CYCLE_START`, where
  `$CYCLE_START` is the `cycle/X` tag created at the beginning of the
  cycle.
* [ ] Create tag for end of cycle: `git tag -s cycle/XXXX-XX-XX`
  * [ ] Includes breaking changes
  * [ ] Includes new features
  * [ ] Includes improvements
  * [ ] Includes shortlog
* Reply to `Release Cycle XXXX-XX-XX` -- includes tag message from
  above

== Patch Review

* [ ] Add remote to mirror, e.g. `git remote add alexj https://github.com/alexjg/radicle-link.git`
* [ ] Pull patch from remote
* [ ] Checkout patch & create topic branch, e.g. `git checkout
      patches/cobs`, `git checkout -b alex/patches/cobs`.
* [ ] Review
* [ ] Merge & push to `seen`

It is advised that you merge often to the `master` branch. This is to
avoid ending up in complex rebasing of your `seen` branch, attempting
to order many patch requests and re-rerolls.

== Patch Promotion

* [ ] Ensure enough reviews have been made
* [ ] Run `seen` on CI
* [ ] If CI **passes**, then merge to `master`
* [ ] If CI **does not pass**, then notify people of breakage
