== Motivation

The motivation for this RFC is two-fold, as can be seen in the linked
discussion. The first is the want to have a protocol mechanism for
replicating a resource when only the URN is known. The second is the
want to be able to configure the fetching of references for a given
remote.

The <<Current Implementation>> had left us with some limitations,
which informed us for this motivation. Learning from these
limitations, the goals for this proposed, reference-based solution are
to scale concurrently and relieve memory pressure.

== Overview

Given the <<Motivation>>, this RFC proposes a replacement of how
tracking is implemented at the time of writing. It will describe how
the tracking relationships will be stored using git, and the format
for the storage contents.

While replication is stated as a motivation, it is out of scope for
this RFC to propose any novel additions to replication of URNs. It
will, however, propose a modification of the existing protocol
semantics for replication when a peer receives a new gossip message.

== Terminology and Conventions

The key words "`MUST`", "`MUST NOT`", "`REQUIRED`", "`SHALL`", "`SHALL NOT`",
"`SHOULD`", "`SHOULD NOT`", "`RECOMMENDED`", "`NOT RECOMMENDED`", "`MAY`", and
"`OPTIONAL`" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119>>
and <<RFC8174>> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.

== Storage

The base requirements for tracking are the capabilities of creating,
updating, deleting, and reading the tracking entries along with their
configurations. The keys for this storage are given by a URN and Peer
ID pairing. The value stored for a given key is the configuration for
that tracking entry. The capabilities that we wish to capture
are:

* *track* a URN with an optional Peer ID
* *untrack* a URN and Peer ID
* *list* tracked URN and PeerIDs
* *update* the configuration of a tracking entry for a given URN and
Peer ID
* *get* the configuration of a tracking entry for a given URN and Peer ID

Any storage backend MUST implement these capabilities, using URN
and Peer IDs as keys. Where a tracking relationship is not using a
Peer ID -- in the case that no Peer IDs are known -- a default MUST be
established.

== Configuration

As mentioned in the <<Motivation>>, we wish to be able to configure
which references we fetch for a given remote. The natural place to
configure this is in the entry for a URN/Peer ID pair.

All data that can be fetched is currently organised into pre-existing
categories found in radicle-link's git implementation today -- stored
as git references. The categories enumerated are:

* `rad`
* `cobs`
* `heads`
* `tags`
* `notes`

The `rad` category is necessary for the verification of data exchanged
on the network. The `cobs` category is the home for
application-defined, code-collaboration artifacts. The `heads`,
`tags`, and `notes` categories are well-known in the domain of git.

The `rad` category MUST always be fetched to persist the validity of
the data found within this category.

Since the `cobs` category can vary in structure and size, as well as
being application specific, we allow the filtering of this data.

The remaining categories are consolidated under the key of
`"data"`. The filtering on these categories is all-or-nothing. This
choice is made to ensure the reasoning of replicating git data. If a
portion of data is filtered, it becomes hard to reason whether this is
a protocol error or a node filtering out this data.

The configuration is REQUIRED to be a key/value format. The
following scheme is REQUIRED to be adhered to:

. `"data": bool`
. `"cobs": "\*" | {<typename>: ("*" | [<object id>])}`

[NOTE]
======
. `<typename>` is any valid name for a collaborative object.
. `<object id>` is any valid collaborative object identifier.
. `"*"` is the wildcard for matching all `"cobs"`, or all objects
under `<typename>`.
======

If `"data"` is set to `true` then all non-`rad` data SHALL be
replicated. If `"data"` is set to `false` then _only_ `rad` data SHALL
be replicated.

For every `<typename>` and set of ``<object id>``'s, these data SHALL
be kept when fetching. The absence of a `<typename>` key SHALL mean
that the `<typename>` is ignored when fetching. Similarly, the absence
of an `<object id>` SHALL mean the given object will be ignored when
fetching.

The default configuration SHALL be to fetch all data and collaborative objects, i.e.
[source,json,id="default-config"]
{ "data": true, "cobs": "*" }

=== Delegates

The data provided by delegates is privileged, as it is generally the
canonical view of the data. It SHALL NOT be possible to filter out any
of the data for a delegate Peer ID. Thus, all configurations for a
delegate Peer ID SHALL be the <<default-config, default
configuration>>.

== Git Storage

Given the outlines in <<Storage>> and <<Configuration>>, we propose
the following implementation using git as the storage layer. The
configuration SHALL be stored as a blob and to retrieve this blob we
SHALL use a well formed reference name for a given URN and Peer ID.

=== Tracking Reference

The reference SHALL be of the form:

----
refs/rad/remotes/<namespace>/(<peer id> | default) <1> <2> <3>
----
<1> `<namespace>` is the multibase-multihash encoded hash of the URN
<2> `<peer id>` is the same format as `<namespace>` based on the
public key of the peer
<3> `default` is the value used when a `<peer id>` is not specified

The reference MUST point directly to the SHA identifier of the blob
that contains the configuration. This differs from the usual use of
references pointing directly to commits. This is intended as we do not
want to keep track of the history of changes for the configuration.

=== Configuration Format

The configuration is REQUIRED to use <<Canonical-JSON>>. This provides
a key/value format, while also being hash friendly for git
purposes. If multiple configurations are equivalent, for example the
default configuration, they can all be represented by the same SHA --
saving storage space.

=== Tracking Semantics

To *track* a new peer the reference (see <<Tracking Reference>>) is
created with the given configuration or <<default-config, default
configuration>> if not specified. If the peer is a delegate, the
configuration SHALL be the <<default-config, default configuration>>
(see <<Delegates>>).

To *untrack* a peer, we remove the reference for the given URN and
Peer ID. We then MAY prune any existing references under
`refs/namespaces/<urn>/refs/remotes/<peer>`.

To *list* the remotes for a given URN, we can use the refspec:
----
refs/rad/remotes/<urn>/*
----

To *list* the remotes for all URNs, we can use the refspec:
----
refs/rad/remotes/**/*
----

To *update* a configuration the new configuration blob can be
created and the reference SHALL point to the new SHA. The update of a
delegate peer SHALL be a no-op (see <<Delegates>>).

To *get* a configuration the blob, located by the reference for the
given URN and Peer ID, read into memory.

== Replication

At the time of writing the protocol has a mechanism for replicating
interesting gossip. When a gossip message is received by the running
peer it will replicate the changes if the running peer is tracking the
URN and Peer ID contained in the gossip message _and_ does not already
store the object corresponding to the git SHA inside the message.

We propose here that this be modified to account for the case where
the running peer has tracked a URN without a Peer ID. The conditions
are modified as follows. If the running peer is *only* tracking the
`default` entry, it SHALL replicate the changes. Otherwise, if the
running peer is tracking the URN and Peer ID contained in the gossip
message _and_ does not already store the object corresponding to the
git SHA inside the message.

== Appendix

=== Current Implementation

We note that an implementation of tracking exists today. The current
implementation utilises the git `<<config>>` file in the monorepo.
Each URN and Peer ID pairing is stored as a `[remote]` key in the
`config`. One downside to this is that it causes memory pressure as
the file grows with each new remote entry. The other downside is that
multiple processes may try to access the single file concurrently.
